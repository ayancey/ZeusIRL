ZeusIRL controls your TENS device (currently supports Pavlok and PiShock) and shocks you whenever you die in CS:GO. It also has other options. It uses [Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration) and does not interact with the game's memory in any way, making it safe to use. (except for the part where you get zapped)

# How to Use

1. Select your device, configure it, and click connect
2. Play around with the various settings, click Start when you are ready
3. Stay in Test Mode until you are comfortable

# Get It

Download the [v1.0 release](https://github.com/ayancey/PavlokCSGO/releases/tag/v1.0) and run the EXE or the Python source code.
